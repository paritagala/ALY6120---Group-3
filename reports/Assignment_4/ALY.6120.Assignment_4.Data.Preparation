Abstract
This project explores employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition
& Performance dataset, with the goal of identifying meaningful patterns that can
strengthen workforce retention strategies. The dataset includes demographic,
organizational, behavioral, and compensation-related variables representative of real
HRIS systems. After detailing data acquisition through Kaggle, this report outlines
internal versus external sourcing, data preparation processes, team collaboration needs,
and data quality assessments. The modelling approach focuses on uncovering the key
drivers of attrition and predicting employees at risk of leaving. Logistic regression is
selected as an interpretable baseline model, supported by decision trees and Random
Forest for deeper pattern detection and improved predictive performance. Together, these
models provide actionable insights into employee turnover, enabling HR leadership to
design targeted interventions grounded in data-driven evidence.
Identify Your Data Sources
For this project, the primary dataset is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition &
Performance dataset. This dataset includes: Employee Demographics: Age, gender,
marital status, education, education field.
Job & Organizational Variables: Job role, department, job level, job satisfaction,
environment satisfaction, work-life balance. Compensation & Benefits: Monthly income,
hourly rate, stock option level, percent salary hike. Performance & Engagement:
Performance rating, relationship satisfaction, training times last year. Workplace
Behavior: Distance from home, overtime status, total working years, job involvement.
Attrition Labels: Whether the employee left the company (Yes/No).
Determine Whether They Can Be Acquired Internally or Externally
Internal Acquisition: In a real corporate setting, HR departments would acquire this type
of data internally from HRIS, payroll, performance management systems, and employee
engagement systems. All the variables present in the IBM dataset map directly to internal
company systems.
External Acquisition: For academic or training purposes, the IBM HR Analytics Attrition
dataset is publicly available externally (e.g., via Kaggle). Therefore, while the dataset
represents internal HR data, it is accessed externally for this project.
How The Data Will Be Acquired
We will obtain the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset from
Kaggle, a reliable source for publicly accessible datasets utilized in both academic and
professional analytics.
Acquisition and Validity : We will go to Kaggle's official IBM HR Analytics repository,
obtain the CSV file, and confirm that it includes the necessary variables (Age, Attrition,
Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, Years at Company, Work-Life Balance, etc.) without
any corruption or missing information.
Protected Storage : The dataset would be stored in a well-organized project directory with
distinct naming rules (e.g., IBM_HR_Analytics_Raw_2025-11-22.csv), keeping the
original file distinct from its processed copies to guarantee reproducibility. Load into
Tools: We would bring the data into Python using pandas (pd.read_csv()) for analysis and
cleaning, or into Power BI through the "Get Data" connector for visualization. Depending
on the modelling needs, we may also use R or Jupyter notebooks.
Document Source: We would maintain a README file documenting the source
(Kaggle), download date, original creators (IBM Watson Analytics), and any
preprocessing steps applied. Since this is a synthetic dataset created for educational
purposes, it contains no real employee information, eliminating privacy concerns while
providing a realistic HR analytics practice.
Team Members We Will Collaborate With
An HR Business partner or HR Analyst will provide domain expertise on workforce
metrics and organizational practices. They would validate my interpretation of variables
like Job Satisfaction and Work Life Balance, explain what constitutes concerning attrition
rates, and help translate analytical findings into actionable retention strategies HR
leadership can implement.
A Data Scientist or Analytics Manager oversees methodology and technical approach.
They would review our feature selection for the attrition prediction model, recommend
appropriate algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest), validate model
performance interpretation, and ensure we follow best practices while avoiding pitfalls
like overfitting.
IT/Database Professional (for real organizational data) manages data access, quality, and
security. While unnecessary for this public Kaggle dataset, they become critical when
working with actual employee information systems, providing data extraction, explaining
table relationships, and ensuring proper security protocols.
HR Leadership (Stakeholders) represents the end users of our analysis. We shall work
together with them to grasp their particular retention inquiries, specify what choices they
must make, and deliver results in understandable formats that encourage action instead of
merely generating technical documents.
Data Governance or Privacy Officer (in practical applications) guarantees adherence to
regulations such as PIPEDA, FIPPA, or GDPR. Although this synthetic dataset doesn't
need supervision, real HR data necessitates their authorization and direction regarding deidentification
and privacy measures.
Within an academic environment, we would partner with our instructor for
methodological advice and engage with classmates for peer evaluations and different
analytical strategies. This cooperative method guarantees that the analysis is technically
robust, relevant to the domain, and applicable for decision-making within the
organization.
Data Preparation and Quality Assessment
In this assignment, before the data would be passed on for further modelling, we would
employ several preparation steps to ensure that there is data quality, reliability, and
suitability for the predictive modelling, considering that the focus for the analysis here is
attrition.
First, missing data would be identified and quantified across all variables. Although there
might be a few Nas in the dataset, any gaps in fields such as education, job role, or
income would require attention. Missing values in numerical variables may be imputed
using simple approaches like mean or median, or flagged for review, while missing
categorical values may need mode imputation or a dedicated unknown category. Rows
with excessive missingness might be removed after several deliberations from the group.
Next, the data would be checked for incorrect values, for example negative ages,
unrealistic total working years, duplicated employee IDs, or inconsistent combinations
such as “Years at Company” greater than “Total Working Years.” Categorical variables
would also require validation to ensure labels are properly formatted and standardized.
Outlier detection is essential for numerical fields such as monthly income, years of
experience, distance from home, or daily rate. The outliers that would be identified may
indicate data entry errors or genuinely extreme cases which would be evaluated and
either corrected or removed depending on context.
The final step would be to ensure correct data types and documenting all cleaning
decisions be to ensure transparency for the modelling team.
Models to Employ and Rationale
To discover meaningful patterns in employee attrition, I would employ a combination of
descriptive, predictive, and explanatory models. Each type of model contributes a
different layer of insight that supports both understanding and decision-making.
1. Logistic Regression (Primary Predictive Model)
Logistic regression is the most appropriate baseline model for attrition because the target
variable—whether an employee left the company—is binary. This model offers:
• Interpretability, allowing HR partners and business leaders to understand the
direction and strength of each predictor (e.g., how overtime or job satisfaction
affects attrition odds).
• Transparency, which is critical for HR decision-making and ethical
considerations.
• Baseline benchmarking, enabling comparisons with more complex models.
Its coefficients help translate statistical patterns into actionable insights, such as
identifying high-risk groups or key drivers of turnover.
2. Decision Trees
Decision trees provide an intuitive, rule-based structure that is easy for non-technical
stakeholders to understand. They reveal:
• Clear segmentation patterns, such as how combinations of variables (e.g., low
job satisfaction + high commute distance) increase attrition likelihood.
• Non-linear relationships that logistic regression might not capture.
Decision trees are particularly useful for creating profile-based retention strategies, as
they visually show which employee groups are at highest risk.
3. Random Forest (Ensemble Model for Enhanced Accuracy)
Random Forest is an ensemble method that aggregates many decision trees, improving
predictive performance and reducing overfitting. This model is ideal for:
• Handling high-dimensional HR data with multiple interacting variables.
• Identifying important predictors through built-in feature importance metrics.
• Capturing complex, non-linear patterns in attrition behavior.
Random Forests are typically one of the strongest models for this dataset, offering both
robustness and high accuracy.
4. Gradient Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost) – Optional for Performance Optimization
If the project requires maximizing predictive accuracy, gradient boosting techniques like
XGBoost can be used. They often outperform simpler models by:
• Sequentially correcting errors of previous trees
• Handling imbalanced datasets more effectively
• Capturing subtle interactions among predictors
However, these models are less interpretable, so they would be used only after ensuring
fairness and transparency.
5. Exploratory Models: Cluster Analysis
Before predictive modelling, cluster analysis (e.g., K-Means) can uncover:
• Natural patterns in employee groups
• Hidden segments such as early-career employees with long commutes or highincome
employees with low engagement
• Profiles where attrition risk is highest
These insights strengthen feature engineering and help HR design targeted interventions.
Summary
A tiered modelling approach—starting with logistic regression for interpretability,
followed by tree-based models for deeper pattern discovery, and optionally advanced
ensemble models for accuracy—ensures both analytical rigor and practical relevance.
Together, these models allow us to uncover the drivers of attrition, predict high-risk
employees, and design evidence-based retention strategies aligned with organizational
priorities.
