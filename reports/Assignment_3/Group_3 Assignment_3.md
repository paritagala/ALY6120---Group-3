### <p> Explain why you have chosen that data </p>

The IBM Employee Attrition dataset was our choice because it provides a genuine and properly
organized ground for understanding the determinants of employee turnover. The dataset consists
of a great variety of demographics, job-related, and organizational variables, which makes it appropriate for both predictive
modelling and insight generation. Moreover, its size is not too large, so it can be analysed quickly and from many angles. At the same time, its extensive
application in HR analytics research gives a great number of benchmarks for results validation. All in all, it encourages the in-depth analysis of
attrition patterns and the use of data for planning the workforce.

### Source for the data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hannycharlotte/employee-attrition-ibm-dataset)
The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset is a synthetic dataset developed by IBM's data scientists, featuring details on 1,470 employees. The dataset comprises 35 variables that include demographic information, job-related attributes, satisfaction indicators, and compensation metrics such as Age, Department, Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, Performance Rating, Work-Life Balance, and Years at Company. This dataset allows for the analysis of elements that lead to employee turnover and helps in developing predictive models to determine those who might be prone to departing. This enables HR teams to implement proactive actions. The dataset is available on Kaggle, making it ideal for machine learning projects and applications centered on predicting attrition.
