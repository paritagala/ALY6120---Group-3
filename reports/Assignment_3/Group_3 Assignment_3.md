<p> Explain why you have chosen that data </p>

The IBM Employee Attrition dataset was our choice because it provides a genuine and properly
organized ground for understanding the determinants of employee turnover. The dataset consists
of a great variety of demographics, job-related, and organizational variables, which makes it appropriate for both predictive
modelling and insight generation. Moreover, its size is not too large so that it can be analysed quickly and from many aspects, while its extensive
application in HR-analytics research gives a great number of benchmarks for results validation. All in all, it encourages the in-depth analysis of
attrition patterns and the use of data for planning the workforce.
